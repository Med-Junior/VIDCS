00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:04.200
Welcome to Vid CS, where you can add some caption to your video files.

00:00:05.633 --> 00:00:09.099
How it works:  in 3 main steps.

00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:13.333
step 1 :  Send your video and the parameters by mail.

00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:17.666
step 2 :  Pay half the total amount.

00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:22.066
finally, step 3 :  Receive your videos with caption by mail.

00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:28.066
If some update need to be made, send them and later you will get the updated video.

00:00:28.066 --> 00:00:32.066
If not, pay the other half of the amount.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Like I said, you can add some caption to your videos files

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
but what are captions?

00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:43.066
Captions are the text you see on a video, most time in the bottom.

00:00:43.233 --> 00:00:46.933
Even if they are almost like subtitles,  they have some differences.

00:00:47.233 --> 00:00:50.233
We will see why,  later on this video.

00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:54.133
Captions come in two forms: closed and open caption.

00:00:55.533 --> 00:01:00.033
Closed caption can be turned on/off by this button. On the Other hand

00:01:08.033 --> 00:01:11.033
subtitles are almost like Captions, but the differences are:

00:01:12.233 --> 00:01:15.233
captions are mostly used for deaf or hard of hearing people.

00:01:16.433 --> 00:01:21.433
subtitles assume viewers can hear and,  mostly used when the viewer does not speak the language in the video.

00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:25.166
so why use them?

00:01:25.433 --> 00:01:31.633
For open caption: help deaf people to understand the video. Useful when the viewer is in a noisy environment.

00:01:33.133 --> 00:01:39.133
For closed caption: they can be turned on/off, because it's not always we like to see them on the screen.

00:01:39.133 --> 00:01:42.499
and it Helps improve your ranking on Google and YouTube.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.500
for subtitle: it's all about the language.

00:01:46.866 --> 00:01:48.866
What about Pricing?

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.500
there are two mode for Pricing: Normal and advanced mode.

00:01:53.466 --> 00:01:56.466
in Normal mode, there will be everything that is said in the video

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.800
even things like stutters, repetitions or false starts.

00:02:01.533 --> 00:02:04.533
in advanced mode,  there won't be those and it will be well-organized

00:02:04.733 --> 00:02:06.233
the names of the speakers are included.

00:02:06.333 --> 00:02:12.633
Here is an example. We have a discussion between Oliver Queen and Johnny Depp.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.700
you will see the result of each mode here.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.700
Now for Normal mode, it's 1€, advanced 1.5 €

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000
and for subtitle or translation in other language, French or English, it will be 2€.

00:02:56.733 --> 00:03:00.733
